# currencyFormatter.js
A super simple currency formatting library by the Bx team at OSREC Technologies

This library was originally created by the Bx team at [OSREC Technologies](https://osrec.co.uk/) while developing Bx ([usebx.com](https://usebx.com)). Having found no library capable of formatting the more unusual currencies they decided to create their own and release it under an MIT Licence. 

[Give Bx a try if you ever need a tool for invoicing, expenses or project management!](https://usebx.com/)
